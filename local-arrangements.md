# Local Arrangements

## Transportation

* After arriving at Austin-Bergstrom Airport, take a taxi to the [Double Tree Hotel](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/texas/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-austin-university-area-AUSIMDT/index.html?WT.mc_id=EPEMDTPreaEN) and check in. If you arrive on Friday prior to check-in time, leave your bags with the concierge.

* Graduate student volunteers will pick up folks at 1:30pm to shuttle them to the College of Liberal Arts building. Alternatively, if the weather is nice (as is likely the case in Austin in the Spring), the walk from the hotel to the CLA building is about 20-25 minutes. Please make sure to arrive slightly before 2:00pm.

* **If you require transportation between the hotel and the University of Texas campus, be sure to [sign up with us on Google Forms](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y0A3278q9ks62XknNsQo7WHeNxsX5SB50QkS8YFhW6g/viewform) so that we can arrange sufficient space in vehicles.**
